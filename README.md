# Credit Risk Analysis

This project is dedicated to creating a data-driven model in Python to estimate the likelihood of default (PD) and generate credit scores for current or prospective borrowers. The credit scores are produced using a transparent, easy-to-understand, and practical scorecard.

## Project Structure

- **Analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including data preprocessing, model development, and scorecard creation.

## Dataset
